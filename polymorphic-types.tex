\section{Polymorphic types}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Polymorphism}

Haskell supports a few kinds of polymorphism -- \textbf{parametric} polymorphism
and \textbf{typeclass} polymorphism.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Parametric polymorphism}

Parametric polymorphism is similar to ``generics'' in other languages (e.g.
Java). It is much simpler in Haskell, and incredibly useful.

What is the type of the following function?

\begin{verbatim}
identity x = x
\end{verbatim}

We might want \texttt{Int -> Int} if we are working with integers, or
\texttt{String -> String}.

Since \texttt{identity} does not care about the structure of its argument, we
can pass it a value of any type, and know that we will get a value of that same
type as the result (in this case, we will get the same value).

We say that \texttt{identity} has the type ``alpha to alpha'', or in Haskell:

\begin{verbatim}
identity :: a -> a
identity x = x
\end{verbatim}

\end{frame}
